Open Education Hackdays in Zuoz

## Back-end
We created a mongodb database that contains information about users and projects.
To-do: 
- Add profiles for companies 
- Add table for open doors events

## Mock-up 
Designed in Adobe Xd. Contains: 
- Landing page 
- Login for studetns and companies 
- Sign up 
- Individual profile 
- Projects overview
- Individual projects

To-do: 
- Page with project description
- Form for sign in
- Update of user infromation
- Calendar

## Next steps
Create front-end and connect it to database. 

Crawl infromation about open doors events for universities: 
- UK: https://www.opendays.com/calendar/
- Switzerland: need to crawl individual pages

Integrate a calendar features that aligns open events, personal schedule and projects
- Decide on calendar
- Import it into personal one 

Aggregate infromation about open doors / student events in companies:
1. Get the list of companies -> get home pages 
2. Define key words for event search 
3. Extract infromation 

### Further ideas
Some ideas that would be cool to have, but not necessary: 
- Chat function to communicate with peers
- Fun facts / News / Information displayed on landing page
