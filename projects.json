Today, teenagers start realizing how their screen time has increased, yet there are no tools and even less culture to tackle the reduction of screen time in particular, and in more general what application categories are used for how much time, for example \"educational\" vs. \"social\" (many of them are called \"social\"). My solution is to collect screen time data and visualize it in order to develop a collec-tive understanding and/or tool to work on the reduction of screen time (digital-off-screen balance) and the balance of application use (reflexive application use balance)."}, {"title": "Flip Teaching Action", "supervisor": 2, "status": "ongoing", "assignedUsers": [2, 6, 8], "description": "The integration of technology in the classroom allows to \u201cflip\u201d the classroom.
